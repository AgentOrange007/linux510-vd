Subject: [PATCH][v3] btrfs: add a force_chunk_alloc to space_info's sysfs
Date:   Mon,  5 Aug 2019 14:31:53 -0400

In testing various things such as the btrfsck patch to detect over
allocation of chunks, empty block group deletion, and balance I've had
various ways to force chunk allocations for debug purposes.  Add a sysfs
file to enable forcing of chunk allocation for the owning space info in
order to enable us to add testcases in the future to test these various
features easier.

[HH: rebased for 5.4]

v2->v3:
- as per Qu's suggestion, moved this to sysfs where it's easier to mess with and
  makes more sense.
- added side-effect is mixed bg forced allocation works with this scheme as
  well.
- had to add get_btrfs_kobj() to get to fs_info, not sure this is better than
  just adding the fs_info to the space_info, am open to other opinions here.

Subject: [PATCH 5/5] btrfs: restart snapshot delete if we have to end the transaction
Date:   Fri, 20 Mar 2020 14:34:36 -0400

This is to fully fix the deadlock described in

btrfs: do not resolve backrefs for roots that are being deleted

Holding write locks on our deleted snapshot across trans handles will
just lead to sadness, and our backref lookup code is going to want to
still process dropped snapshots for things like qgroup accounting.

Fix this by simply dropping our path before we restart our transaction,
and picking back up from our drop_progress key.  This is less efficient
obviously, but it also doesn't deadlock, so it feels like a reasonable
trade off.

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: do not evaluate the expression with !CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT
Date: Fri, 24 Jul 2020 12:41:47 -0400

While investigating a performance issue I noticed that turning off
CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT had no effect in what I was seeing in perf,
specifically check_setget_bounds() was around 5% for this workload.
Upon investigation I realized that I made a mistake when I added
ASSERT(), I would still evaluate the expression, but simply ignore the
result.

This is useless, and has a marked impact on performance.  This
microbenchmark is the watered down version of an application that is
experiencing performance issues, and does renames and creates over and
over again.  Doing these operations 200k times without this patch takes
13 seconds on my machine.  With this patch it takes 7 seconds.

Subject: [PATCH v3 01/12] btrfs: make flush_space take a enum btrfs_flush_state instead of int
Date:   Fri,  9 Oct 2020 09:28:18 -0400

I got a automated message from somebody who runs clang against our
kernels and it's because I used the wrong enum type for what I passed
into flush_space.  Change the argument to be explicitly the enum we're
expecting to make everything consistent.  Maybe eventually gcc will
catch errors like this.

Subject: [PATCH v3 02/12] btrfs: add a trace point for reserve tickets
Date:   Fri,  9 Oct 2020 09:28:19 -0400

While debugging a ENOSPC related performance problem I needed to see the
time difference between start and end of a reserve ticket, so add a
trace point to report when we handle a reserve ticket.

I opted to spit out start_ns itself without calculating the difference
because there could be a gap between enabling the tracpoint and setting
start_ns.  Doing it this way allows us to filter on 0 start_ns so we
don't get bogus entries, and we can easily calculate the time difference
with bpftrace or something else.

Subject: [PATCH v3 03/12] btrfs: track ordered bytes instead of just dio ordered bytes
Date:   Fri,  9 Oct 2020 09:28:20 -0400

We track dio_bytes because the shrink delalloc code needs to know if we
have more DIO in flight than we have normal buffered IO.  The reason for
this is because we can't "flush" DIO, we have to just wait on the
ordered extents to finish.

However this is true of all ordered extents.  If we have more ordered
space outstanding than dirty pages we should be waiting on ordered
extents.  We already are ok on this front technically, because we always
do a FLUSH_DELALLOC_WAIT loop, but I want to use the ordered counter in
the preemptive flushing code as well, so change this to count all
ordered bytes instead of just DIO ordered bytes.

Subject: [PATCH v3 04/12] btrfs: introduce a FORCE_COMMIT_TRANS flush operation
Date:   Fri,  9 Oct 2020 09:28:21 -0400

Sole-y for preemptive flushing, we want to be able to force the
transaction commit without any of the ambiguity of
may_commit_transaction().  This is because may_commit_transaction()
checks tickets and such, and in preemptive flushing we already know
it'll be helpful, so use this to keep the code nice and clean and
straightforward.

Subject: [PATCH v3 05/12] btrfs: improve preemptive background space flushing
Date:   Fri,  9 Oct 2020 09:28:22 -0400

Currently if we ever have to flush space because we do not have enough
we allocate a ticket and attach it to the space_info, and then
systematically flush things in the file system that hold space
reservations until our space is reclaimed.

However this has a latency cost, we must go to sleep and wait for the
flushing to make progress before we are woken up and allowed to continue
doing our work.

In order to address that we used to kick off the async worker to flush
space preemptively, so that we could be reclaiming space hopefully
before any tasks needed to stop and wait for space to reclaim.

When I introduced the ticketed ENOSPC stuff this broke slightly in the
fact that we were using tickets to indicate if we were done flushing.
No tickets, no more flushing.  However this meant that we essentially
never preemptively flushed.  This caused a write performance regression
that Nikolay noticed in an unrelated patch that removed the committing
of the transaction during btrfs_end_transaction.

The behavior that happened pre that patch was btrfs_end_transaction()
would see that we were low on space, and it would commit the
transaction.  This was bad because in this particular case you could end
up with thousands and thousands of transactions being committed during
the 5 minute reproducer.  With the patch to remove this behavior you got
much more sane transaction commits, but we ended up slower because we
would write for a while, flush, write for a while, flush again.

To address this we need to reinstate a preemptive flushing mechanism.
However it is distinctly different from our ticketing flushing in that
it doesn't have tickets to base it's decisions on.  Instead of bolting
this logic into our existing flushing work, add another worker to handle
this preemptive flushing.  Here we will attempt to be slightly
intelligent about the things that we flushing, attempting to balance
between whichever pool is taking up the most space.

All of our normal flushing is asynchronous reclaim, so this helper is
poorly named.  This is more checking if we need to preemptively flush
space, so rename it to need_preemptive_reclaim.

Subject: [PATCH v3 08/12] btrfs: rework btrfs_calc_reclaim_metadata_size
Date:   Fri,  9 Oct 2020 09:28:25 -0400

Currently btrfs_calc_reclaim_metadata_size does two things, it returns
the space currently required for flushing by the tickets, and if there
are no tickets it calculates a value for the preemptive flushing.

However for the normal ticketed flushing we really only care about the
space required for tickets.  We will accidentally come in and flush one
time, but as soon as we see there are no tickets we bail out of our
flushing.

Fix this by making btrfs_calc_reclaim_metadata_size really only tell us
what is required for flushing if we have people waiting on space.  Then
move the preemptive flushing logic into need_preemptive_reclaim().  We
ignore btrfs_calc_reclaim_metadata_size() in need_preemptive_reclaim()
because if we are in this path then we made our reservation and there
are not pending tickets currently, so we do not need to check it, simply
do the fuzzy logic to check if we're getting low on space.

Subject: [PATCH v3 10/12] btrfs: implement space clamping for preemptive flushing
Date:   Fri,  9 Oct 2020 09:28:27 -0400

Starting preemptive flushing at 50% of available free space is a good
start, but some workloads are particularly abusive and can quickly
overwhelm the preemptive flushing code and drive us into using tickets.

Handle this by clamping down on our threshold for starting and
continuing to run preemptive flushing.  This is particularly important
for our overcommit case, as we can really drive the file system into
overages and then it's more difficult to pull it back as we start to
actually fill up the file system.

The clamping is essentially 2^CLAMP, but we start at 1 so whatever we
calculate for overcommit is the baseline.

Subject: [PATCH v3 12/12] btrfs: add a trace class for dumping the current ENOSPC state
Date:   Fri,  9 Oct 2020 09:28:29 -0400

Often when I'm debugging ENOSPC related issues I have to resort to
printing the entire ENOSPC state with trace_printk() in different spots.
This gets pretty annoying, so add a trace state that does this for us.
Then add a trace point at the end of preemptive flushing so you can see
the state of the space_info when we decide to exit preemptive flushing.
This helped me figure out we weren't kicking in the preemptive flushing
soon enough.

Date:   Fri, 13 Nov 2020 11:24:17 +0000

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

At inode.c:cow_file_range_inline(), after we insert the inline extent
in the fs/subvolume btree, we call btrfs_drop_extent_cache() to drop
all extent maps in the file range, however that is not necessary because
we have already done it in the call to btrfs_drop_extents(), which calls
btrfs_drop_extent_cache() for us, and since at this point we have the file
range locked in the inode's iotree (we are in the writeback path), we know
no other task can come in and read stale file extent items or find none
and therefore create either stale extent maps or an extent map that
represens a hole.

So just remove that unnecessary call to btrfs_drop_extent_cache(), as it's
doing nothing and only wasting time. This call has been around since 2008,
introduced in commit c8b978188c9a ("Btrfs: Add zlib compression support"),
but even back then it seems it was not necessary, since we had the range
locked in the inode's iotree and the call to btrfs_drop_extents() already
used to always call btrfs_drop_extent_cache().

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: skip unnecessary searches for xattrs when logging an inode
Date:   Fri, 13 Nov 2020 11:21:49 +0000

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

Every time we log an inode we lookup in the fs/subvol tree for xattrs and
if we have any, log them into the log tree. However it is very common to
have inodes without any xattrs, so doing the search wastes times, but more
importanly it adds contention on the fs/subvol tree locks, either making
the logging code block and wait for tree locks or making the logging code
making other concurrent operations block and wait.

The most typical use cases where xattrs are used are when capabilities or
ACLs are defined for an inode, or when SELinux is enabled.

This change makes the logging code detect when an inode does not have
xattrs and skip the xattrs search the next time the inode is logged,
unless the inode is evicted and loaded again or a xattr is added to the
inode. Therefore skipping the search for xattrs on inodes that don't ever
have xattrs and are fsynced with some frequency.

The following script that calls dbench was used to measure the impact of
this change on a VM with 8 cpus, 16Gb of ram, using a raw NVMe device
directly (no intermediary filesystem on the host) and using a non-debug
kernel (default configuration on Debian distributions):

  $ cat test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/sdk
  MNT=/mnt/sdk
  MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o ssd"

  mkfs.btrfs -f -m single -d single $DEV
  mount $MOUNT_OPTIONS $DEV $MNT

  dbench -D $MNT -t 200 40

  umount $MNT

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: stop incrementing log batch when joining log transaction
Date:   Fri, 13 Nov 2020 11:23:30 +0000

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

When joining a log transaction we acquire the root's log mutex, then
increment the root's log batch and log writers counters while holding
the mutex. However we don't need to increment the log batch there,
because we are holding the mutex and incremented the log writers counter
as well, so any other task trying to sync log will wait for the current
task to finish its logging and still achieve the desired log batching.

Since the log batch counter is an atomic counter and is incremented twice
at the very beginning of the fsync callback (btrfs_sync_file()), once
before flushing delalloc and once again after waiting for writeback to
complete, eliminating its increment when joining the log transaction
may provide some performance gains in case we have multiple concurrent
tasks doing fsyncs against different files in the same subvolume, as it
reduces contention on the atomic (locking the cacheline and bouncing it).

When testing fio with 32 jobs, on a 8 cores vm, doing fsyncs against
different files of the same subvolume, on top of a zram device, I could
consistently see gains (higher throughput) between 1% to 2%, which is a
very low value and possibly hard to be observed with a real device (I
couldn't observe consistent gains with my low/mid end NVMe device).
So this change is mostly motivated to just simplify the logic, as updating
the log batch counter is only relevant when an fsync starts and while not
holding the root's log mutex.

Subject: [PATCH 1/6] btrfs: fix race causing unnecessary inode logging during link and rename
Date: Wed, 25 Nov 2020 12:19:23 +0000

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

When we are doing a rename or a link operation for an inode that was logged
in the previous transaction and that transaction is still committing, we
have a time window where we incorrectly consider that the inode was logged
previously in the current transaction and therefore decide to log it to
update it in the log. The following steps give an example on how this
happens during a link operation:

1) Inode X is logged in transaction 1000, so its logged_trans field is set
   to 1000;

2) Task A starts to commit transaction 1000;

3) The state of transaction 1000 is changed to TRANS_STATE_UNBLOCKED;

4) Task B starts a link operation for inode X, and as a consequence it
   starts transaction 1001;

5) Task A is still committing transaction 1000, therefore the value stored
   at fs_info->last_trans_committed is still 999;

6) Task B calls btrfs_log_new_name(), it reads a value of 999 from
   fs_info->last_trans_committed and because the logged_trans field of
   inode X has a value of 1000, the function does not return immediately,
   instead it proceeds to logging the inode, which should not happen
   because the inode was logged in the previous transaction (1000) and
   not in the current one (1001).

This is not a functional problem, just wasted time and space logging an
inode that does not need to be logged, contributing to higher latency
for link and rename operations.

So fix this by comparing the inodes' logged_trans field with the
generation of the current transaction instead of comparing with the value
stored in fs_info->last_trans_committed.

This case is often hit when running dbench for a long enough duration, as
it does lots of rename operations.

This patch belongs to a patch set that is comprised of the following
patches:

  btrfs: fix race causing unnecessary inode logging during link and rename
  btrfs: fix race that results in logging old extents during a fast fsync
  btrfs: fix race that causes unnecessary logging of ancestor inodes
  btrfs: fix race that makes inode logging fallback to transaction commit
  btrfs: fix race leading to unnecessary transaction commit when logging inode
  btrfs: do not block inode logging for so long during transaction commit

Performance results are mentioned in the change log of the last patch.

Subject: [PATCH 2/6] btrfs: fix race that results in logging old extents during a fast fsync
Date: Wed, 25 Nov 2020 12:19:24 +0000

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

When logging the extents of an inode during a fast fsync, we have a time
window where we can log extents that are from the previous transaction and
already persisted. This only makes us waste time unnecessarily.

The following sequence of steps shows how this can happen:

1) We are at transaction 1000;

2) An ordered extent E from inode I completes, that is it has gone through
   btrfs_finish_ordered_io(), and it set the extent maps' generation to
   1000 when we unpin the extent, which is the generation of the current
   transaction;

3) The commit for transaction 1000 starts by task A;

4) The task committing transaction 1000 sets the transaction state to
   unblocked, writes the dirty extent buffers and the super blocks, then
   unlocks tree_log_mutex;

5) Some change is made to inode I, resulting in creation of a new
   transaction with a generation of 1001;

6) The transaction 1000 commit starts unpinning extents. At this point
   fs_info->last_trans_committed still has a value of 999;

7) Task B starts an fsync on inode I, and when it gets to
   btrfs_log_changed_extents() sees the extent map for extent E in the
   list of modified extents. It sees the extent map has a generation of
   1000 and fs_info->last_trans_committed has a value of 999, so it
   proceeds to logging the respective file extent item and all the
   checksums covering its range.

   So we end up wasting time since the extent was already persisted and
   is reachable through the trees pointed to by the super block committed
   by transaction 1000.

So just fix this by comparing the extent maps generation against the
generation of the transaction handle - if it is smaller then the id in the
handle, we know the extent was already persisted and we do not need to log
it.

This patch belongs to a patch set that is comprised of the following
patches:

  btrfs: fix race causing unnecessary inode logging during link and rename
  btrfs: fix race that results in logging old extents during a fast fsync
  btrfs: fix race that causes unnecessary logging of ancestor inodes

Subject: [PATCH 3/6] btrfs: fix race that causes unnecessary logging of ancestor inodes
Date: Wed, 25 Nov 2020 12:19:25 +0000

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

When logging an inode and we are checking if we need to log ancestors that
are new, if the previous transaction is still committing we have a time
window where we can unncessarily log ancestor inodes that were created in
the previous transaction.

The race is described by the following steps:

1) We are at transaction 1000;

2) Directory inode X is created, its generation is set to 1000;

3) The commit for transaction 1000 is started by task A;

4) The task committing transaction 1000 sets the transaction state to
   unblocked, writes the dirty extent buffers and the super blocks, then
   unlocks tree_log_mutex;

5) Inode Y, a regular file, is created under directory inode X, this
   results in starting a new transaction with a generation of 1001;

6) The transaction 1000 commit is unpinning extents. At this point
   fs_info->last_trans_committed still has a value of 999;

7) Task B calls fsync on inode Y and gets a handle for transaction 1001;

8) Task B ends up at log_all_new_ancestors() and then because inode Y has
   only one hard link, ends up at log_new_ancestors_fast(). There it reads
   a value of 999 from fs_info->last_trans_committed, and sees that the
   parent inode X has a generation of 1000, so we end up logging inode X:

     if (inode->generation > fs_info->last_trans_committed) {
         ret = btrfs_log_inode(trans, root, inode,
                               LOG_INODE_EXISTS, ctx);
         (...)

   which is not necessary since it was created in the past transaction,
   with a generation of 1000, and that transaction has already committed
   its super blocks - it's still unpinning extents so it has not yet
   updated fs_info->last_trans_committed from 999 to 1000.

   So this just causes us to spend more time logging and allocating and
   writing more tree blocks for the log tree.

So fix this by comparing an inode's generation with the generation of the
transaction our transaction handle refers to - if the inode's generation
matches the generation of the current transaction than we know it is a
new inode we need to log, otherwise don't log it.

This case is often hit when running dbench for a long enough duration.

This patch belongs to a patch set that is comprised of the following
patches:

  btrfs: fix race causing unnecessary inode logging during link and rename
  btrfs: fix race that results in logging old extents during a fast fsync
  btrfs: fix race that causes unnecessary logging of ancestor inodes
  btrfs: fix race that makes inode logging fallback to transaction commit
  btrfs: fix race leading to unnecessary transaction commit when logging inode
  btrfs: do not block inode logging for so long during transaction commit

Performance results are mentioned in the change log of the last patch.

Subject: [PATCH 4/6] btrfs: fix race that makes inode logging fallback to transaction commit
Date: Wed, 25 Nov 2020 12:19:26 +0000

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

When logging an inode and the previous transaction is still committing, we
have a time window where we can end up incorrectly think an inode has its
last_unlink_trans field with a value greater than the last transaction
committed, which results in the logging to fallback to a full transaction
commit, which is usually much more expensive than doing a log commit.

The race is described by the following steps:

1) We are at transaction 1000;

2) We modify an inode X (a directory) using transaction 1000 and set its
   last_unlink_trans field to 1000, because for example we removed one
   of its subdirectories;

3) We create a new inode Y with a dentry in inode X using transaction 1000,
   so its generation field is set to 1000;

4) The commit for transaction 1000 is started by task A;

5) The task committing transaction 1000 sets the transaction state to
   unblocked, writes the dirty extent buffers and the super blocks, then
   unlocks tree_log_mutex;

6) Some task starts a new transaction with a generation of 1001;

7) We do some modification to inode Y (using transaction 1001);

8) The transaction 1000 commit starts unpinning extents. At this point
   fs_info->last_trans_committed still has a value of 999;

9) Task B starts an fsync on inode Y, and gets a handle for transaction
   1001. When it gets to check_parent_dirs_for_sync() it does the checking
   of the ancestor dentries because the following check does not evaluate
   to true:

       if (S_ISREG(inode->vfs_inode.i_mode) &&
           inode->generation <= last_committed &&
           inode->last_unlink_trans <= last_committed)
               goto out;

   The generation value for inode Y is 1000 and last_committed, which has
   the value read from fs_info->last_trans_committed, has a value of 999,
   so that check evaluates to false and we proceed to check the ancestor
   inodes.

   Once we get to the first ancestor, inode X, we call
   btrfs_must_commit_transaction() on it, which evaluates to true:

   static bool btrfs_must_commit_transaction(...)
   {
       struct btrfs_fs_info *fs_info = inode->root->fs_info;
       bool ret = false;

       mutex_lock(&inode->log_mutex);
       if (inode->last_unlink_trans > fs_info->last_trans_committed) {
           /*
            * Make sure any commits to the log are forced to be full
            * commits.
            */
            btrfs_set_log_full_commit(trans);
            ret = true;
       }
    (...)

    because inode's X last_unlink_trans has a value of 1000 and
    fs_info->last_trans_committed still has a value of 999, it returns
    true to check_parent_dirs_for_sync(), making it return 1 which is
    propagated up to btrfs_sync_file(), causing it to fallback to a full
    transaction commit of transaction 1001.

    We should have not falled back to commit transaction 1001, since inode
    X had last_unlink_trans set to 1000 and the super blocks for
    transaction 1000 were already written. So while not resulting in a
    functional problem, it leads to a lot more work and higher latencies
    for a fsync since committing a transaction is usually more expensive
    than committing a log (if other filesystem changes happened under that
    transaction).

Similar problem happens when logging directories, for the same reason as
btrfs_must_commit_transaction() returns true on an inode with its
last_unlink_trans having the generation of the previous transaction and
that transaction is still committing, unpinning its freed extents.

So fix this by comparing last_unlink_trans with the id of the current
transaction instead of fs_info->last_trans_committed.

This case is often hit when running dbench for a long enough duration, as
it does lots of rename and rmdir operations (both update the field
last_unkink_trans of an inode) and fsyncs of files and directories.

This patch belongs to a patch set that is comprised of the following
patches:

  btrfs: fix race causing unnecessary inode logging during link and rename
  btrfs: fix race that results in logging old extents during a fast fsync
  btrfs: fix race that causes unnecessary logging of ancestor inodes
  btrfs: fix race that makes inode logging fallback to transaction commit
  btrfs: fix race leading to unnecessary transaction commit when logging inode
  btrfs: do not block inode logging for so long during transaction commit

Performance results are mentioned in the change log of the last patch.

Subject: [PATCH 5/6] btrfs: fix race leading to unnecessary transaction commit when logging inode
Date: Wed, 25 Nov 2020 12:19:27 +0000

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

When logging an inode we may often have to fallback to a full transaction
commit, either because a new block group was allocated, there is some case
we can not deal with wihout a transaction commit or some error like an
-ENOMEM happened. However after we fallback to a transaction commit, we
have a time window where we can make the next attempt to log any inode
commit the next transaction unnecessarily, adding additional overhead and
increasing latency.

A sequence of steps that leads to this issue is the following:

1) The current open transaction has a generation of 1000;

2) A new block group is allocated, and as a consequence we must make sure
   any attempts to commit a log fallback to a transaction commit, so
   btrfs_set_log_full_commit() is called from btrfs_make_block_group().
   This sets fs_info->last_trans_log_full_commit to 1000;

3) Task A is holding a handle on transaction 1000 and tries to log inode X.
   Once it gets to start_log_trans(), it calls btrfs_need_log_full_commit()
   which returns true, since fs_info->last_trans_log_full_commit has a
   value of 1000. So we end up returning -EAGAIN and propagating it up to
   btrfs_sync_file(), where we commit transaction 1000;

4) The transaction commit task (task A) sets the tansaction state to
   unblocked (TRANS_STATE_UNBLOCKED);

5) Some other task, task B, starts a new transaction with a generation of
   1001;

6) Some stuff is done with transaction 1001, some btree blocks COWed, etc;

7) Transaction 1000 has not fully committed yet, we are still writing all
   the extent buffers it created;

8) Some new task, task C, starts an fsync of inode Y, gets a handle for
   transaction 1001, and it gets to btrfs_log_inode_parent() which does
   the following check:

     if (fs_info->last_trans_log_full_commit > last_committed) {
         ret = 1;
         goto end_no_trans;
     }

   At that point last_trans_log_full_commit has a value of 1000 and
   last_committed (value of fs_info->last_trans_committed) has a value of
   999, since transaction 1000 has not yet committed - it is either still
   writing out dirty extent buffers, its super blocks or unpinning
   extents.

   As a consequence we return 1, which gets propagated up to
   btrfs_sync_file(), which will then call btrfs_commit_transaction()
   for transaction 1001.

   As a consequence we have an unnecessary second transaction commit, we
   previously committed transaction 1000 and now commit transaction 1001
   as well, resulting in more overhead and increased latency.

So fix this double transaction commit issue simply by removing that check,
because all we need to do is wait for the previous transaction to finish
its commit, which we already do later when starting the log transaction at
start_log_trans(), because there we acquire the tree_log_mutex lock, which
is held by a transaction commit and only released after the transaction
commits its super blocks.

Another issue that check has is that it reads last_trans_log_full_commit
without using READ_ONCE(), which is incorrect since that member of
struct btrfs_fs_info is always updated with WRITE_ONCE() through the
helper btrfs_set_log_full_commit().

This double transaction commit issue can actually be triggered quite often
in long runs of dbench, since besides the creation of new block groups
that force inode logging to fallback to a transaction commit, there are
cases where dbench asks to fsync a directory which had files in it that
were previously renamed or subdirectories that were removed, resulting in
the inode logging to fallback to a full transaction commit.

This patch belongs to a patch set that is comprised of the following
patches:

  btrfs: fix race causing unnecessary inode logging during link and rename
  btrfs: fix race that results in logging old extents during a fast fsync
  btrfs: fix race that causes unnecessary logging of ancestor inodes
  btrfs: fix race that makes inode logging fallback to transaction commit
  btrfs: fix race leading to unnecessary transaction commit when logging inode
  btrfs: do not block inode logging for so long during transaction commit

Performance results are mentioned in the change log of the last patch.

Subject: [PATCH 6/6] btrfs: do not block inode logging for so long during transaction commit
Date: Wed, 25 Nov 2020 12:19:28 +0000

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

Early on during a transaction commit we acquire the tree_log_mutex and
hold it until after we write the super blocks. But before writing the
extent buffers dirtied by the transaction and the super blocks we unblock
the transaction by setting its state to TRANS_STATE_UNBLOCKED and setting
fs_info->running_transaction to NULL.

This means that after that and before writing the super blocks, new
transactions can start. However if any transaction wants to log an inode,
it will block waiting for the transaction commit to write its dirty
extent buffers and the super blocks because the tree_log_mutex is only
released after those operations are complete, and starting a new log
transaction blocks on that mutex (at start_log_trans()).

Writing the dirty extent buffers and the super blocks can take a very
significant amount of time to complete, but we could allow the tasks
wanting to log an inode to proceed with most of their steps:

1) create the log trees
2) log metadata in the trees
3) write their dirty extent buffers

They only need to wait for the previous transaction commit to complete
(write its super blocks) before they attempt to write their super blocks,
otherwise we could end up with a corrupt filesystem after a crash

So change start_log_trans() to use the root tree's log_mutex to serialize
for the creation of the log root tree instead of using the tree_log_mutex,
and make btrfs_sync_log() acquire the tree_log_mutex before writing the
super blocks. This allows for inode logging to wait much less time when
there is a previous transaction that is still committing, often not having
to wait at all, as by the time when we try to sync the log the previous
transaction already wrote its super blocks.

This patch belongs to a patch set that is comprised of the following
patches:

  btrfs: fix race causing unnecessary inode logging during link and rename
  btrfs: fix race that results in logging old extents during a fast fsync
  btrfs: fix race that causes unnecessary logging of ancestor inodes
  btrfs: fix race that makes inode logging fallback to transaction commit
  btrfs: fix race leading to unnecessary transaction commit when logging inode
  btrfs: do not block inode logging for so long during transaction commit

The following script that uses dbench was used to measure the impact of
the whole patchset:

  $ cat test-dbench.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/nvme0n1
  MNT=/mnt/btrfs
  MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o ssd"

  echo "performance" | \
      tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

  mkfs.btrfs -f -m single -d single $DEV
  mount $MOUNT_OPTIONS $DEV $MNT

  dbench -D $MNT -t 300 64

  umount $MNT

The test was run on a machine with 12 cores, 64G of ram, using a NVMe
device and a non-debug kernel configuration (Debian's default).

Subject: [PATCH v5 1/8] btrfs: do not block on deleted bgs mutex in the cleaner
Date:   Fri, 18 Dec 2020 14:24:19 -0500

While running some stress tests I started getting hung task messages.
This is because the delete unused bg's code has to take the
delete_unused_bgs_mutex to do it's work, which is taken by balance to
make sure we don't delete block groups while we're balancing.

The problem is a balance can take a while, and so we were getting hung
task warnings.  We don't need to block and run these things, and the
cleaner is needed to do other work, so trylock on this mutex and just
bail if we can't acquire it right away.

Subject: [PATCH v5 2/8] btrfs: only let one thread pre-flush delayed refs in commit
Date:   Fri, 18 Dec 2020 14:24:20 -0500

I've been running a stress test that runs 20 workers in their own
subvolume, which are running an fsstress instance with 4 threads per
worker, which is 80 total fsstress threads.  In addition to this I'm
running balance in the background as well as creating and deleting
snapshots.  This test takes around 12 hours to run normally, going
slower and slower as the test goes on.

The reason for this is because fsstress is running fsync sometimes, and
because we're messing with block groups we often fall through to
btrfs_commit_transaction, so will often have 20-30 threads all calling
btrfs_commit_transaction at the same time.

These all get stuck contending on the extent tree while they try to run
delayed refs during the initial part of the commit.

This is suboptimal, really because the extent tree is a single point of
failure we only want one thread acting on that tree at once to reduce
lock contention.  Fix this by making the flushing mechanism a bit
operation, to make it easy to use test_and_set_bit() in order to make
sure only one task does this initial flush.

Once we're into the transaction commit we only have one thread doing
delayed ref running, it's just this initial pre-flush that is
problematic.  With this patch my stress test takes around 90 minutes to
run, instead of 12 hours.

Subject: [PATCH v5 3/8] btrfs: delayed refs pre-flushing should only run the heads we have
Date:   Fri, 18 Dec 2020 14:24:21 -0500

Previously our delayed ref running used the total number of items as the
items to run.  However we changed that to number of heads to run with
the delayed_refs_rsv, as generally we want to run all of the operations
for one bytenr.

But with btrfs_run_delayed_refs(trans, 0) we set our count to 2x the
number of items that we have.  This is generally fine, but if we have
some operation generation loads of delayed refs while we're doing this
pre-flushing in the transaction commit, we'll just spin forever doing
delayed refs.

Fix this to simply pick the number of delayed refs we currently have,
that way we do not end up doing a lot of extra work that's being
generated in other threads.

Subject: [PATCH v5 4/8] btrfs: only run delayed refs once before committing
Date:   Fri, 18 Dec 2020 14:24:22 -0500

We try to pre-flush the delayed refs when committing, because we want to
do as little work as possible in the critical section of the transaction
commit.

However doing this twice can lead to very long transaction commit delays
as other threads are allowed to continue to generate more delayed refs,
which potentially delays the commit by multiple minutes in very extreme
cases.

So simply stick to one pre-flush, and then continue the rest of the
transaction commit.

Subject: [PATCH v5 5/8] btrfs: move delayed ref flushing for qgroup into qgroup helper
Date:   Fri, 18 Dec 2020 14:24:23 -0500

The commit d67263354541 ("btrfs: qgroup: Make snapshot accounting work
with new extent-oriented qgroup.") added a flush of the delayed refs
during snapshot creation in order to get the qgroup accounting properly.
However this code has changed and been moved to it's own helper that is
skipped if qgroups are turned off.  Move the flushing to the helper, as
we do not need it when qgroups are turned off.

Also add a comment explaining why it exists, and why it doesn't actually
save us.  This will be helpful later when we try to fix qgroup
accounting properly.

Subject: [PATCH v5 6/8] btrfs: remove bogus BUG_ON in alloc_reserved_tree_block
Date:   Fri, 18 Dec 2020 14:24:24 -0500

The fix 361048f586f5 ("Btrfs: fix full backref problem when inserting
shared block reference") added a delayed ref flushing at subvolume
creation time in order to avoid hitting this particular BUG_ON().

Before this fix, we were tripping the BUG_ON() by

1. Modify snapshot A, which creates blocks with a normal reference for
   snapshot A, as A is the owner of these blocks.  We now have delayed
   refs for these blocks.
2. Create a snapshot of A named B, which pushes references for the
   children blocks of the root node for the new root B, thus creating
   more delayed refs for newly allocated blocks.
3. A is modified, and because the metadata blocks can now be shared, it
   must push FULL_BACKREF references to the children of any block that A
   cow's down it's path to its target key.
4. Delayed refs are run.  Because these are newly allocated blocks, we
   have ->must_insert_reserved reserved set on the delayed ref head, we
   call into alloc_reserved_tree_block() to add the extent item, and
   then add our ref.  At the time of this fix, we were ordering
   FULL_BACKREF delayed ref operations first, so we'd go to add this
   reference and then BUG_ON() because we didn't have the FULL_BACKREF
   flag set.

The patch fixed this problem by making sure we ran the delayed refs
before we had the chance to modify A.  This meant that any *new* blocks
would have had their extent items created _before_ we would ever
actually cow down and generate FULL_BACKREF entries.  Thus the problem
went away.

However this BUG_ON() is actually completely bogus.  The existence of a
full backref doesn't necessarily mean that FULL_BACKREF must be set on
that block, it must only be set on the actual parent itself.  Consider
the example provided above.  If we cow down one path from A, any nodes
are going to have a FULL_BACKREF ref pushed down to _all_ of their
children, but not all of the children are going to have FULL_BACKREF
set.  It is completely valid to have an extent item with normal and full
back refs without FULL_BACKREF actually set on the block itself.

As a final note, I have been testing with the patch

  btrfs: stop running all delayed refs during snapshot

which removed this flushing.  My test was a torture test which did a lot
of operations while snapshotting and deleting snapshots as well as
relocation, and I never tripped this BUG_ON().  This is actually because
at the time of 361048f586f5, we ordered SHARED keys _before_ normal
references, and thus they would get run first.  However currently they
are ordered _after_ normal references, so we'd do the initial creation
without having a shared reference, and thus not hit this BUG_ON(), which
explains why I didn't start hitting this problem during my testing with
my other patch applied.

Subject: [PATCH v5 7/8] btrfs: stop running all delayed refs during snapshot
Date:   Fri, 18 Dec 2020 14:24:25 -0500

This was added in commit 361048f586f5 ("Btrfs: fix full backref problem
when inserting shared block reference") to address a problem where we
hit the following BUG_ON() in alloc_reserved_tree_block

        if (node->type == BTRFS_SHARED_BLOCK_REF_KEY) {
                BUG_ON(!(flags & BTRFS_BLOCK_FLAG_FULL_BACKREF));

However this BUG_ON() is bogus, and was removed by

  btrfs: remove bogus BUG_ON in alloc_reserved_tree_block

We no longer need to run delayed refs because of this, and can remove
this flushing here.

Subject: [PATCH v5 8/8] btrfs: run delayed refs less often in commit_cowonly_roots
Date:   Fri, 18 Dec 2020 14:24:26 -0500

We love running delayed refs in commit_cowonly_roots, but it is a bit
excessive.  I was seeing cases of running 3 or 4 refs a few times in a
row during this time.  Instead simply update all of the roots first,
then run delayed refs, then handle the empty block groups case, and then
if we have any more dirty roots do the whole thing again.  This allows
us to be much more efficient with our delayed ref running, as we can
batch a few more operations at once.
